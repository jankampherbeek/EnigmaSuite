    <h1>Calculations: Mean and true obliquity of the earth's axis</h1>
    <p>You can calculate the <i>Mean Obliquity</i>  and the <i>True Obliquity</i> for a given date. The true obliquity takes disturbances due to nutation into account and changes less smoothly than the mean obliquity.</p>
    <h2>Data input</h2>
    <p>You need to enter the date, the obliquity is calculated for 0:00 UT for this date.</p>
    <p>The format for the date is <b>yyyy/mm/dd</b>. You can skip leading zero's, both 2022/05/22 and 2022/5/22 will be accepted.</p>
    <p>Select either the <i>Julian</i> or the <i>Gregorian calendar</i>. Default the Gregorian calendar is selected as it is always applicable for current dates.</p>
    <p>
        Select a <i>yearcount</i>. For dates in CE there is no difference with the astronomical yearcount. For years BCE there is a difference of 1 year.
        The historical year 0 does not exist but is indicated as -1 BCE. Astronomical, this is the year 0. The historical year -2 is the same as the astronomical year -1.

    <h2>Calculation results</h2>
    <p>After entering the required data you can click the button <b>Calculate</b>. If your input did not contain errors, you will see the results of the calculation in the bottom part of the screen. 
    If Enigma did find errors, the input field(s) with the error will return yellow.</p>
    <h2>Reset</h2>
    <p>Click the button <b>Reset</b> to clear all entered fields and the calculated results. You can also change the input and just press <b>Calculate</b> again.</p>
    <h2>Back to the Calculation overview</h2>
    <p>Click the button <b>Close</b> to close the screen for the calculation of the Obliquity and to return to the overview screen for calculations.</p>
