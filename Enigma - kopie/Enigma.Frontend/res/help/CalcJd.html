    <h1>Calculations: Julian Day and Delta T</h1>
    <p>You can calculate the <i>Julian Day</i> for UT and for ET. The difference between these values is called <i>Delta T</i> and is caused by disturbances at the earthglobe, like earthquakes. The calculator gives the values for Delta T both in days and in seconds.</p>
    <h2>Data input</h2>
    <p>You need to enter the date and the time</p>
    <p>The format for the date is <b>yyyy/mm/dd</b>. You can skip leading zero's, both 2022/05/22 and 2022/5/22 will be accepted.</p>
    <p>Enter the time in UT (Universal Time or Greenwich Time). Use the format <b>hh:mm:ss</b> in 24-hour notation. Leading zero's and the value for seconds are optional. Both 21:01:00 and 21:1 will be accepted.</p>
    <p>Select either the <i>Julian</i> or the <i>Gregorian calendar</i>. Default the Gregorian calendar is selected as it is always applicable for current dates.</p>
    <p>
        Select a <i>yearcount</i>. For dates in CE there is no difference with the astronomical yearcount. For years BCE there is a difference of 1 year.
        The historical year 0 does not exist but is indicated as -1 BCE. Astronomical, this is the year 0. The historical year -2 is the same as the astronomical year -1.
