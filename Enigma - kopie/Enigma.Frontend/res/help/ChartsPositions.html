<h1>Radix positions</h1>
<p>Positions in a radix can be expressed in different coordinate systems. 
Enigma shows you the most relevant positions and speeds.</p>
<p>This screen is divided in three parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Name and other details for the calculated chart.</li>
	<li>Positions for houses and related points.</li>
	<li>Positions for planets and other celestial points.</li>
</ul>
If one of the tables does not show all information, you can scroll both vertically and horizontally. 
Alternatively, you can resize the screen. The tables will automatically adapt to the new screen size.
<h2>Name and details</h2>
<p>Here you can see the inputted details for this chart. 
If you did not enter the name for the chart it is called <i>Anonymous</i>.</p>
<h2>Houses</h2>
<p>The top-right table contains the positions for the houses. 
It shows the MC, Ascendant, twelve cusps, Vertex and East Point.
MC and cusp 10 will be the same in most, but not all, systems. The same goes for the ascendant and cusp 1. </p>
<p>The table contains Longitude, Right Ascension (RA), Declination, Azimuth and Altitude. See the next paragraph for a description. Latitude is omitted as cusps always have a latitude of zero. Cusps have no measurable distance and the daily speed is irrelevant. These items have also been omitted.</p>
<h2>Celestial points.</h2>
<p>For the planets and other celestial points that you selected for the calculation, all positions are shown.
In the columns you will find subsequently:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Celestial point</b>, indicated by its symbol.</li>
<li><b>Longitude</b>, the usual position in the ecliptic, including the glyph for the zodiacal sign.</li>
<li><b>Speed long</b>, the daily speed in longitude. Retrograde is indicated with a minus-sign.</li>
<li><b>Latitude</b>, the deviation from the ecliptic. A minus-sign indicates southern latitude, otherwise the latitude is north.</li>
<li><b>Speed lat</b>, the daily speed in latitude. A minus-sign indicates a movement in southern direction, otherwise the movement is going north.</li>
<li><b>RA</b>, Right Ascension. The position at the celestial equator, measured in degrees.</li>
<li><b>Speed RA</b>, the daily speed in right ascension. Retrograde is indicated with a minus-sign.</li>
<li><b>Declination</b>, the deviation from the equator. A minus-sign indicates southern declination, otherwise the declination is north.</li>
<li><b>Speed decl</b>, the daily speed in declination. A minus-sign indicates a movement in southern direction, otherwise the movement is going north.</li>
<li><b>Distance</b>, the distance measured in AU's (Astronomical Units, the distance between Sun and Earth).</li>
<li><b>Speed dist</b>, the daily change in distance. A minus sign indicates a decrease in distance, otherwise the distance is increasing.</li>
<li><b>Azimuth</b>, the compass-direction, measured at the horizon. South = 0&deg;, West = 90&deg;, North = 180&deg; and East = 270&deg;.</li>
<li><b>Altitude</b>, the height above or under (minus-sign) the horizon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The East Point</h2>
<p>The East Point is the intersection between equator and horizon. One might expect that the east point always has an azimuth of 270&deg;.
However, the east point is projected to the ecliptic and the azimuth of the projected ecliptical point is calculated. This leads to a difference of several degrees.
