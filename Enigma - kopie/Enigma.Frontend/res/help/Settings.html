<h1>Settings</h1>



<p>Settings define the location of files that Enigma uses. In version 0.1 these locations are fixed.</p>
<p>The current locations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location of data files</strong>: <code>c:\enigma\data</code>  Data files contain data, currently only in csv-format,  that can be used by projects.</li>
<li><strong>Location of project files</strong>: <code>c:\enigma\project</code> Project files include files with description of projects and files that are converted to Json format.</li>
<li><strong>Location of export files</strong>: <code>c:\enigma\export</code> Files that you export, currently only in csv-format.</li>
<li><strong>Location of Swiss Ephemeris files</strong>: <code>c:\enigma\se</code> The files as supplied by the Swiss Ephemeris that contain the data for the calculations. These files will (almost) never change.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Csv</em> (comma delimited values) is the format that is used by spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel and Libre Office Calc to export data.</p>
<p><em>Json</em> is a format that is mostly used by software but can be read by humans. </p>
