    <p>To import data, you need to select a file in the correct csv-format and define a unique name for the data. This name is used to define the data in research projects.</p>
    <p>To select a file you can use the button <strong>Browse for file</strong>. This will open a standard window to find and select a file. The selected file will show in the field after &#39;Select the file with data&#39;.</p>
    <p>After completing this information, you can click the button <strong>Import file</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you did not enter all required information, or if you used a name for the data that is already in use, you will get a popup window with an explanation of what is wrong.</p>
    <p>If no errors occurred, a text that clarifies the result is shown in the filed underneath &#39;Result of the import&#39;.</p>
    <p>After a successful import, you can either perform another import or click the button <strong>Close</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you change your mind and want to skip the import, click the button <strong>Cancel</strong>.</p>
