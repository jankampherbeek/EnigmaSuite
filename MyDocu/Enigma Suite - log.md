## Starting with C#

Decision to start with C# version of Enigma:  2021-12-28 14:43, Enschede.

Main reasons, compared to Object Pascal:

- Visual Studio has excellent support for UI, better than Delphi/FireMonkey, which is better than FP/Lazarus/VCL.
- IDE is superior to Lazarus.
- Many requirements are already available in the standard environment of Visual Studio.
- Long term support for the environment is less risky.
- Long term support for essential libraries is less risky. E.g. Spring4D is essential for Delphi but maintained by one person: Stefan Glienke.
- Documentation is better available and easily accessible.
- Earlier experiences with C# were very positive.
- More non-commercial libraries available, compared to Delphi.

Main reasons, compared to Java/Kotlin:

- Better language (compared to Java) or on equal foot (compared to Kotlin).
- UI Support. JavaFX is becoming risky and Jetpack Compose for Desktop is in its infancy. And as it is a Google product, Jetpack could be terminated at any moment.
- Deployment is integrated in VS, no need for external tools to embed the runtime.

Drawbacks

- Larger footprint than Delphi/FP (.NET environment is included).
- Probably not as fast as Delphi/FP.
- Dependency on commercial party (Microsoft), while FP is not commercial. Compared to Delphi though, Microsoft seems to be a more secure commercial party than Embarcadero.
- Personally, I prefer the Pascal syntax. More verbose but also better readability.

I have been changing languages far too often. For astrology projects: Delphi 7, Delphi Express edition, Java, C#, Java, Kotlin, Free Pascal, Kotlin, Free Pascal, Delphi, C#.
