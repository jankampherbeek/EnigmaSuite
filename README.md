# EnigmaSuite
EnigmaSuite is the repository for Enigma Astrology Research, software that is aimed at supporting research into astrology. 
Enigma supports both quantitative and qualitative research.

After finishing release 0.5, a Windows program, the goal was to create a cross-platform version 1.0 of Enigma. Unfortunately, I needed to pause my activities for a while because of circumstances beyond my control. But rest assured that I will start again with fresh energy.

Release 0.5 provides the basics: calculation, drawing, analysis, specifics for declination, progressive techniques (including primary directions), and support for research.

Before starting again with release 1.0, I will create release 0.6 in which I will add support for two approaches: the Black Lights Astrology as promoted by George Bode and the Prenatal approach by Eg Sneek. This release also includes support for geographic coordinates and timezones. And I will optimize the research module, resulting in smaller file sizes and faster processing. Release 0.6 is still a Windows program.

Version 0.5 is already a usable astrology program and version 0.6, will have some important improvements.
