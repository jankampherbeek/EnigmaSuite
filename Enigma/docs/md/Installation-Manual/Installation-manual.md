# Installation manual Enigma Astrology Research 0.5


## Requirements

You need a computer that runs Windows. 
I have tested Enigma on Windows 11, it probably runs on older versions, but not older than Windows 7. 
Enigma will probably run in a Windows emulator on Apple hardware, but I did not test that.

The program requires about 160 mb disk space and about 4 GB internal memory.
Preferably, use a full HD screen or larger.

## Performing the installation

Download the installation program from [*https://radixpro.com/enigma*](https://radixpro.com/downloads/enigma). 
You will receive a file e*nigma_ar_install.exe* which you can save anywhere on your computer.

Double-click this file to start the installation.

Enigma shows a license which you should accept to continue. 
Select *I accept the agreement* and click the button **Next**.



## Additional actions for Microsoft Edge

These actions are only required for Microsoft Edge. 
If you use another browser continue with the paragraph Additional actions for other browsers.

If you try to download with Micrososoft Edge you will see a message indicating that the install program is unsafe to 
download and was blocked by SmartScreen Filter.
Click the link *More info*.

Now you see three dots in the message window. Click these three dots.
Windows now shows a screen with a text that this app might be unsafe. Click the link *Show more*.

Now click the link *Keep anyway* and then the link *Open file*.

## Additional actions for other browsers

If you use Chrome or Firefox to download the installation program, you will probably see one or two screens with warnings. 
I do not use a certificate with which Windows can check if the program is really downloaded from my site. 
That is for a simple reason: such a certificate costs a serious amount of money on a yearly base. 
You will be safe if you download only from the original site: radixpro.com.

If you see a blue screen with the text *Windows protected your PC,* you need to click the link *More info* and then 
the button *Run anyway*.

If you see the warning *Do you want to allow the following program from an unknown publisher to make changes to this 
computer?* Just click *Yes*.




## Installation

The installer shows a license which you should accept to continue. 
Select *I accept the agreement* and click the button **Next**.

On this window, you can select the folder where you want to install Enigma. 
I advise to use the default location.

Click the button **Next**.


Enigma uses *RadixPro* as the start menu folder, but you can change this if you prefer another folder.

Click the button **Next**.

If you select the checkbox *Create a desktop shortcut*, the installer will create an icon on your desktop to start Enigma.

Click the button **Next**.

Review your selections and click the button **Install**.

You will see a progress bar during installation.

If you see this window, the installer completed its task. Optionally, select the checkbox *Launch Enigma Astrology Research* to start Enigma.

Click the button **Finish**.

The installer made the following changes to your system:

- It installed Enigma in *C:\Program Files (x86)\Enigma Astrology Research*. This folder also contains a sub-folder *se* with the required files from the Swiss Ephemeris, a sub-folder *res* with help-files, and a sub-folder *runtimes* that contains logic for the database. You should never change anything in these folders.
- The font *EnigmaAstrology* is available. You can use this font also in other applications. For more information, check [*http://radixpro.com/downloads/font*](http://radixpro.com/downloads/font)/

Enigma uses the folder c:/enigma_ar and its sub-folders. After starting, Enigma creates these folders automatically, if they do not yet exist.



## After installation

If you start Enigma the first time after installation, you might get a request to install *.Net Runtime*. This is additional software from MicroSoft that is required to run the program. If this Runtime is already available on your computer, you will not see this request. Click the download link in the window about this Runtime. After downloading it, you can click the downloaded file to install the Runtime.

## Removing Enigma

It is easy to remove Enigma. In the settings of Windows, you can select an overview of installed apps. 
Search for Enigma Astrology Research and remove it.

## Updating Enigma

Each time you start Enigma, it will check if a new version is available. 
It will perform this check only if it can find a connection to the Internet.

Enigma will inform you of any new release and show a link to download and install it. 
You can always install without removing the previous release, provided you do not change the location of the installed 
application.
