    <h1>New project</h1>
    <p> Before you can create a project, a datafile already needs to have been imported. 
        If you did not yet import a datafile, please do so now. Menu: <b>Data - Import Data</b>.</p>
    
    <h2 id='description-of-the-project'>Description of the project</h2>
    <p>To define the project you need to provide a <i>name</i> and a <i>description</i>. 
        Both fields are obligatory.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In <b>Name for project</b> you enter the name you want to use for your project.</li>
        <li>In <b>Description</b> you can enter additional information about the project, 
            typically a short description of your intended research.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id='control-group'>Control group</h2>
    <p>
        Defining a project includes the creation of data for a control group. 
        Currently you can only select <i>Standard shifting of location, date and time</i>. 
        In future releases, Enigma will support additional methods to create a controlgroup.
    </p>

    <h2 id='multiplication'>Multiplication for control group</h2>
    <p>
        Select one of the available values as multiplication factor for the controlgroup. 
        You can select either 1 (no multiplication), 10, 100 or 1000. 
        By defining a multiplication factor you can enlarge the controlgroup. 
    </p>
    
    <h2 id='datafile-to-be-used'>Datafile to be used</h2>
    <p>Select a datafile from the list of available datafiles. 
        If the list is empty you need to define a datafile first. Menu: <b>Data - Import Data</b>. </p>
    
    <h2 id='saving-the-project'>Saving the project</h2>
    <p>If you click the button <strong>Save</strong>, Enigma will check your input and underline incorrect 
        input fields with a red color. 
    If there are no errors, a folder structure for this project, a datafile and a control file are generated. 
    If during this process an error occurs, you will receive a popup about the error. 
    Otherwise you will receive a confirmation popup. After closing this popup you will return to the main screen.</p>
