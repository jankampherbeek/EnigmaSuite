    <h1>Charts import</h1>
    <p>Enigma supports importing data from external sources. 
        Currently, you can import data from <i>PlanetDance</i>, a well known program, written by Jean Cremers.
        In future editions, I will add more external sources.</p>
    <p>To import data, you will first need to export the data from PlanetDance.
        The user manual contains a detailed description how to perform this export. 
        Please note that it is essential to strictly follow the description in the user manual.
        The appendix in the user manual contains a detailed description of the internal format of the exported data,
        but you do not need this information to perform a successful import.</p>
    <p>After exporting a file from PlanetDance, you need to select this file.
        Click the button <strong>Browse</strong>. 
        This will open a standard window to find and select a file. 
        The selected file will show in the field &#39;Select the file with data&#39;.</p>
    <p>After selecting the file, you can click the button <strong>Import</strong>.</p>
    <p>If no errors occurred, a text that clarifies the result is shown in the lower part of the screen.</p>
    <p>After a successful import, you can click the button <strong>Close</strong>.</p>
    <p>You can now select the imported charts in the usual way.</p>
