<h1>Midpoints</h1>

<p>In this window you will see two tables. 
  The left table contains a list of all midpoints, regardless if they are occupied or not.  
  The table to the right shows occupied midpoints for a specific dial. </p>
<p>Both tables will contain only celestial points that you selected in the configuration.</p>
<p>For the occupied midpoints you will also see the actual orb and a percentage for the exactness of the midpoint. 
  The higher the percentage, the smaller the orb.</p>
<p>Default a dial of 360 degrees is used for the occupied midpoints. 
  You can change the dial with the radio buttons to the right of the two tables. 
  Currently, Enigma supports the dials for 360 degrees, 90 degrees and 45 degrees. The orb for all dials is the same.</p>
<p>After changing the selection of the dial, the content of the table with Occupied midpoints will automatically update.</p>
<p>
  You can sort the columns in the table <i>Occupied Midpoints</i> by clicking the header.
