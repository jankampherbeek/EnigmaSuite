	<h1>Input for an event</h1>
	<p>In this screen you define an event that can be analysed with progressive techniques.</p>
	<p><strong>Description</strong>. A descriptive text for the progressive event.</p>
	<h2 id='location'>Location</h2>
	<p>The information about the location is optional. In most cases it would not make a difference.
	If you use parallax, the position of the Moon will be effected.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Name of location</strong>. A city name, address or other identification for the  location. 
		The default value is <em>No location</em>.</p>
	<p><strong>Longitude</strong>. Geographic longitude in the format <em>ddd:mm:ss</em>. 
		For  <em>123°45&#39;30&quot;</em> you need to enter <em>123:45:30</em>. 
		You can skip the seconds, they will default to 0 seconds. 
		So <em>145:15</em> is a valid indication for  <em>145°15&#39;00&quot;</em>. </p>
	<p>Use the scroll-down box to select either <strong>East</strong> or <strong>West</strong>. </p>
	<p><strong>Latitude</strong>. Geographic latitude in the format <em>dd:mm:ss</em>. 
		For <em>52°13&#39;30&quot;</em> you need to enter <em>52:13:30</em>. 
		You can skip the seconds, they will default to 0 seconds. 
		So <em>45:15</em> is a valid indication for <em>45°15&#39;00&quot;</em>. </p>
	<p>Use the scroll-down box to select either <strong>North</strong> or <strong>South</strong>.</p>

	<h2 id='date-and-time'>Date and time</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Date</strong>. Enter the date in the format <em>yyyy:mm:dd</em>, so June 16, 2022  would be 
		entered as <em>2022/06/16</em>.
	</p>
	<p>Enigma assumes all dates for events are relatively recent. Therefore the Gregorian Calendar is used.
	If you really want to calculate the progressions for ancient periods, make sure to convert the Gregorian calendar
		to Julian and to apply the astronomical yearcount before the year 0.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Time</strong>. Enter the time in the format <em>hh:mm:ss</em>, using 24 hour notation. 
		2h38m30s PM would be <em>14:38:30</em>. You can also leave the default time of 12:00.</p>
	<p><strong>TimeZone</strong>. Select one of the available timezones. 
		The list contains the offset from UT (Greenwich Time) and the name of the timezone. 
		If the time does not match with one of the available timezones, select <em>LMT: Local Mean Time</em>.  
		You will get the possibility to define another offset from UT for the time  used.</p>
	<p><strong>Apply DST</strong>. Check the box <em>Apply DST</em> if Daylight Saving Time is applicable.</p>
	<p><strong>Longitude for LMT</strong>. This field becomes available if you selected LMT as timezone. 
		Here you can define the geographic longitude for the offset in degrees, minutes, and seconds, using the 
		format ddd:mm:ss in the same way as for entering the geographic longitude for the location. 
	Also select either <strong>East</strong> or <strong>West</strong> to indicate the direction for the offset.</p>
	<h2 id='start-the-calculation'>Finish the definition of the event</h2>
	<p>Click the button <strong>Save</strong> to finish the definition of the event. 
		If you made any errors, Enigma will show a popup with information about those errors. 
		After you corrected the errors, you can again click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
	<p>Click the button <strong>Cancel</strong> if you do not want to continue.</p>
