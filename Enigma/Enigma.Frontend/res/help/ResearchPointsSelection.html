<h1>Select points for test</h1>
<p>For each test, you will need to define the points to include in the test. The screen shows all points in a list, points that are not selected in the current configuration are not shown.</p>  
 <p>If you are missing a point you need to redefine the configuration: click the button <strong>Cancel</strong> to close this window and return to the overview of tests, where you can also open the configuration window.</p>
<p>You can select one or more points by clicking them. Deselect by clicking again. You can select/deselect all points by clicking the checkbox <strong>Select all points</strong>.</p>
<p>With the checkbox <strong>Include all cusps</strong> you can include all cusps but this option is only available for specific types of research. Please note that Ascendant and MC can also be selected, for quadrant systems you have to be aware of this effect. </p>
<p>Click the button <strong>OK</strong> to start the calculations.</p>
