<h1>Harmonics</h1>
<p>The table contains both the radix positions and the harmonic positions for all celestial points that you selected 
  in the configuration, and additionally for the MC and the Ascendant. </p>
<p>Initially, the harmonics are calculated for the 2nd harmonic. 
  You can change the harmonic by entering a number underneath <em>Enter number for new harmonic</em> and clicking 
  the button <strong>Calculate</strong>. </p>
<p>The number of the harmonic should be larger than 1 and not larger than 100,000.</p>
<p>After clicking this button, the content of the table with harmonics will automatically update.</p>
<p>Enigma also supports fractional harmonics: harmonics for non-integer numbers. 
  You can enter a fractional number the same way as an integer number. 
  Use the decimal separator (dot or comma) that you normally use on your computer.</p>
<p>The effective harmonic is shown above the table with positions.</p>
