        <h1>Heliacal risings and settings</h1>
        <p>Heliacal risings and settings were an important technique in ancient astrology. 
            Enigma supports the calculation of these events for the visible planets (including the Moon). 
            Fixed stars are not yet supported.</p>
        <h2>Celestial object</h2>
        <p>Select Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter or Saturn.</p>
        <h2>Type of event</h2>
        <p>Select one of the following event types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heliacal rising</strong>, the first visibility of a celestial object before sunrise.</li>
            <li><strong>Heliacal setting</strong>, the last visibility of a celestial object after sunset.</li>
            <li><strong>Evening first (Mercury, Venus, Moon)</strong>, the first visibility after sunset. 
                Only possible for Mercury, Venus and Moon.</li>
            <li><strong>Morning last (Mercury, Venus, Moon)</strong>, the last visibility after sunrise.
                Only possible for Mercury, Venus and Moon.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Start date</h2>
        <p>Enigma calculates the heliacal events after the start date.
            Enter the start date in the format <strong>yyyy/mm/dd</strong> and select the correct calendar.
            The date is always assumed to be an astronomical date.</p>        
        <h2>Longitude</h2>
            <p>Enter the geographic longitude in the format <strong>ddd:mm:ss</strong> and select 
                <strong>East</strong> or <strong>West</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Latitude</h2>
        <p>Enter the geographic latitude in the format <strong>dd:mm:ss</strong> and select
            <strong>North</strong> or <strong>South</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Altitude in meters</h2>
        <p>For enhanced precision, Enigma asks you to enter the altitude. 
            You need to enter the values in meters. Negative values are allowed but do not use fractions.
            The altitude should be larger than -420 meter and smaller than 8850 meter. 
            In case you are wondering: these are respectively the lowest point on Earth (borders of the Dead Sea) 
            and the highest point on earth (the peak of the Mount Everest with a small margin added for eye sight).</p>
        <p>See the user manual to learn more about finding the correct altitude.</p>
        <h2>Calculate</h2>
        <p>Click the button <strong>Calculate</strong> to start the calculation.
            If you did not enter all required information, or if you used a wrong format,
            you will get a popup window with an explanation of what is wrong.
            You will need to fix the input to start the comparison.</p>
