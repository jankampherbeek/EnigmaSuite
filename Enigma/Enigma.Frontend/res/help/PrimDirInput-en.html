<h1>Define a period for primary directions.</h1>
<p>To calculate primary directions, you need to define a period. 
    Enigma will calculate all primary directions that are formed in this period.
</p>
<p>Please not that all dates are considered to be in the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<h2>Conditions</h2>

<p>The dates need to follow the following rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the format yyyy/mm/dd</li>
    <li>The start date should be at least one day after the date of birth.</li>
    <li>The end date should be later than the start date.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you click <em>Calculate</em> Enigma will show the primary directions. 
    If you made an error in the input, a popup-window is shown instead.</p>
