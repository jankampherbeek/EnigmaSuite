<h1>Longitude equivalents</h1>
<p>A <i>longitude equivalent</i> (LE) of a point is the longitude that corresponds with the declination if the point 
    would have no latitude.
    For points that never have longitude, like the Sun and the lunar node, the LE is always the same as the real longitude.
    A special situation occurs when a planet is Out of Bounds (OOB): there are no longitudes that correspond to an OOB position. 
    Usage is to use in such a case a fictive declination, called the <i>co-declination</i>. 
    Please select the user manual for more information.
 </p>
<p>The table shows the Points, their longitude and declination. 
    The co-declination is empty, unless a point is OOB.  
    The last column contains the Longitude Equivalent, abbreviated to <i>Long. Equiv.</i></p>
