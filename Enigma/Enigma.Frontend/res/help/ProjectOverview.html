<h1>Projects overview</h1>
<p>This screen shows an overview of existing projects. If you did not yet define a project, the overview of projects will be empty.</p>
<p>In the menu you can check the current settings: <strong>General - Settings</strong>, and check or change the Configuration: <strong>General - Configuration</strong>.</p>
<p>To check the available data sets, use the menu <strong>Data - Available data sets</strong>. You can import a new data set via the menu <strong>Data - Import data</strong>. </p>
<p>Before you can define a new project, you already must have imported a dataset. To define a new project use the menu <strong>Research Projects - Add new project</strong> or the button <strong>New</strong>. A project needs to have access to one data set. If you want to use multiple data sets you will need to define multiple projects.</p>
<p>You can start research on an existing project by selecting the project in the list and clicking the button <strong>Open</strong>. A new screen will appear that will ask you to select a method to perform a test.</p>
