    <h1>Enigma - Charts</h1>
    <p>
        This is the main screen for working with charts.
        You can add new charts, retrieve charts from the database, show a chart wheel, analyze the charts and use progressive techniques.
        And you can also change the configuration that influences the calculation and analysis of the charts.
    </p>

    <h2>General information</h2>
    <p>
        Under the heading <i>Charts</i>, you see information about the charts in the database: the number of charts and the last added chart.
        And you see the chart that is currently selected, if any.
    </p>

    <h2>Available charts</h2>
    <p>
        Under the heading <i>Available charts</i>, you see an overview of calculated charts and charts retrieved from the database.
        Initially, this table is empty.
    </p>

    <h2>Menu</h2>
    <p>
        The menu gives you access to all functions.
        Some functionality is also available via the buttons on the right.
    </p>
    <p>The menu option <b>General - Settings</b> shows the current location of files that Enigma uses.</p>
    <p>
        Via <b>General - Configuration</b> you can show and change the configuration.
        If you change the configuration, Enigma removes the content in the table under <i>Available Charts</i>.
