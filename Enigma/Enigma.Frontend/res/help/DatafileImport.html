    <h1>Data Import</h1>
	<p>You can select two types of datafiles: files in the standard format for Enigma, and data that you exported from PlanetDance.</p>
    <p>To import data, you need to select the type of datafile and a file in the corresponding csv-format. You also need to define a unique name for the data. This name is used to define the data in research projects.</p>
    <p>In the user manual you will find information about the csv-formats for both types of data.</p>
    <p>To select a file you can use the button <strong>Browse for file</strong>. This will open a standard window to find, and select, a file. The selected file will show in the field after <i>Select the file with data</i>.</p>
    <p>After completing this information, you can click the button <strong>Import file</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you did not enter all required information, or if you used a name for the data that is already in use, Enigma will show a warning with an explanation of what went wrong.</p>
    <p>If no errors occurred, a text that clarifies the result is shown in the filed underneath <i>Result of the import</i>.</p>
    <p>After a successful import, you can either perform another import or click the button <strong>Close</strong>.</p>
