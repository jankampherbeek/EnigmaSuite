    <h1>Enigma - Charts</h1>
    <p>
        This is the main screen for working with charts.
        You can add new charts, retrieve charts from the database, and analyze the charts.
        And you can change the configuration that influences the calculation and analysis of the charts.
    </p>

    <h2>General information</h2>
    <p>
        Under the heading <i>Charts</i>, you see information about the charts in the database: the number of charts and the last added chart.
        And you see the chart that is currently selected, if any.
    </p>

    <h2>Available charts</h2>
    <p>
        Under the heading <i>Available charts</i>, you see an overview of calculated charts and charts retrieved from the database.
        Initially, this table is empty.
    </p>

    <h2>Menu</h2>
    <p>
        The menu gives you access to all functions.
        Some functionality is also available via the buttons on the right.
    </p>
    <p>The menu option <b>General - Settings</b> shows the current location of files that Enigma uses.</p>
    <p>
        Via <b>General - Configuration</b> you can show and change the configuration.
        If you change the configuration, Enigma removes the content in the table under <i>Available Charts</i>.
