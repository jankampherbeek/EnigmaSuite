<h1>Select points for test</h1>
<p>For each test, you will need to define the points to include in the test. The screen shows Celestial Points (Lights, planets, minor planets, mathematical points) in the list to the left, and Mundane points (related to houses) in the list to the right.</p>
<p>Points that are not selected in the current configuration are not shown.  If you are missing a point you need to redefine the configuration: click the button <strong>Cancel</strong> to close this window and return to the overview of tests, where you can also open the configuration window.</p>
<p>You can select one or more points by clicking them. Deselect by clicking again. You can select/deselect all celestial or all mundane points by clicking one of the checkboxes <strong>Select all celestial points</strong> or <strong>Select all mundane points</strong>.</p>
<p>With the checkbox <strong>Include all cusps</strong> you can include all cusps into the research. This means you can count aspects to cusps or use cusps in midpoints, etc. Please note that Ascendant and MC can also be selected, for quadrant systems you have to be aware of this effect. </p>
<p>Click the button <strong>OK</strong> to start the calculations.</p>
