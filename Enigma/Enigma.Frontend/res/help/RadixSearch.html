<h1>Search for chart</h1>
<p>You can search for a chart by providing a part of the name. 
    Enigma automatically uses wild cards, so do not add them. 
    A search for John will recognize charts for John Lennon but also for Lyndon Johnson and Mary Bluejohn.</p>
<p>The search is case insensitive; Enigma makes no difference between lower case and upper case.</p>
<p>Leave the search term empty to find all charts.</p>
<p>The number of charts you can find is limited to 100.</p>
<p>After clicking the <b>Search</b> button, the results show in the table <i>Search results</i>. 
    Click the chart you want to examine: the search window will close and the chart shows in the list of <i>Available Charts</i> in the main charts screen.</p>
