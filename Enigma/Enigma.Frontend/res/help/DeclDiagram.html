<h1>Declination diagram.</h1>

<p>
    In this diagram you see an overview of declinations and longitudes.
    At the left and the right, the diagram shows the degrees in declination. 
    In most cases the range will be from 30 to -30 (30 North to 30 South).
    If one of the points has a declination larger than 30 degrees, Enigma will extend that range.
</p>
<p>
    The zones where a point is Out of Bounds, at the top and bottom of the diagram, show a darker background color.
    The outline of the oval form shows the declination for points with zero latitude (like the Sun).
    Points with northern latitude are in the top half of the oval form.
    The lower half contains points with southern latitude.
</p>
<p>
    The diagram shows 6 columns, each for a pair of ecliptical signs. 
    For each point you will see a horizontal line that indicates the exact declination.
    A vertical line, directed to the top or the bottom of the diagram, indicates the longitude.
</p>
<p>
    You can hide the position lines by clicking the checkbox <i>Hide position lines</i>.
</p>
<p>The diagram also shows the actual obliquity and positions in longitude and declination.</p>
