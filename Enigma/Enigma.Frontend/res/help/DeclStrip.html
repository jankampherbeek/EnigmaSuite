<h1>Declination strip</h1>

<p>
The declination strip shows a graphical presentation of the declinations. 
    At the left of the bar with degrees, you see the points with northern declination.
    At the right, you will find the points with southern declination.
    This makes it easy to visualize parallels and contra-parallels.
</p>
<p>At the top of the diagram, you will see a darker region. Points in this region are Out of Bounds.</p>
<p>The diagram also shows the actual obliquity and positions in longitude and declination.</p>
