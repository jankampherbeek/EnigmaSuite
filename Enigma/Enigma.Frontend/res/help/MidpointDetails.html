    <h1>Details for midpoints</h1>
    <p>In this screen you define additional details for midpoints. </p>
    <h2 id='dial-size'>Dial size</h2>
    <p>You can calculate midpoints in different <em>dials</em>. A dial is a division of the  zodiac in zero, 4 or 8 parts. A finer division is not yet possible in Enigma but  will be added in release 0.3.</p>
    <p>You can select one of the following dials: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>360°</strong>: no division. </li>
        <li><strong>90°</strong>: a division by 4. </li>
        <li><strong>45°</strong>: a division by 8. </li>

    </ul>
    <h2 id='orb-1'>Orb</h2>
    <p>You can define your own orb. As the number of midpoints can be quite high, it  makes sense to use a relatively small orb, typically smaller than 2° if you use  a 360° dial and smaller for the other dials.</p>
    <p>The orb should be defined in positive numeric values, the minutes should be  between 0 and 59. The maximum total size is 9°59&#39;. However, such a large orb  probably does not make any sense. If your orb is not correctly defined you will  be warned with a popup after pressing the OK-button. </p>
