<h1>Details for midpoints</h1>
<h2>Dial size</h2>
<p>You can calculate midpoints in differnet 'dials'. A dial is a division of the zodiac in zero, 4 or 8 parts. A finer division is not yet possible in Enigma but will be added in release 0.3.</p>
You can select one of the following dials:
<ul>
<li><b>360&deg;</b>: no division.</li>
<li><b>90&deg;</b>: a division by 4.</li>
<li><b>45&deg;</b>: a division by 8.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Orb</h2>
<p>You can define your own orb. As the number of midpoints can be quite high, it makes sense to use a relatively small orb, typically smaller than 2&deg; if you use a 360&deg; dial and smaller for the other dials.</p>
<p>The orb should be defined in positive numeric values, the minutes should be between 0 and 59. The maximum total size is 9&deg;59'. However, such a large orb probably does not make any sense. If your orb is not correctly defined you will be warned with a popup after pressiong the OK-button.
