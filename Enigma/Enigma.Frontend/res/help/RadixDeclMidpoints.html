<h1>Midpoints in declination</h1>

<p>This window shows a table with the occupied midpoints in declination. </p>
<p>The table contains only celestial points that you selected in the configuration.
You can change the effective orb of 0&deg;36' in the configuration.</p>
<p>For the occupied midpoints you will also see the actual orb and a percentage for the exactness of the midpoint.
    The higher the percentage, the smaller the orb.</p>
