<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>In the configuration, you can define your astrological preferences. Enigma provides a default configuration at 
  install time, but you can override that configuration. </p>
<p>In the menu you can define your preferences for:</p>
<ul>
<li>General selections that have effect on the calculations: Tab <em>General</em>.</li>
<li>Selection of celestial bodies and their orbs: Tab <em>Points</em>.</li>
<li>Selection of aspects and their orbs: Tab <em>Aspects</em>.</li>
<li>The colors that you want to use for aspects in a chart figure: Tab <em>Colors</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After changing the configuration, you can save it by clicking on the button <strong>Save</strong>. 
  Saving is done simultaneously for the settings on all tabs. 
  If you made an error you will get a popup with a warning and the data will not be saved. 
  Locate the error, correct it and click OK again.</p>
<p>Click the button <strong>Cancel</strong> to ignore your changes and to close this window.</p>

<h2 id='general-selections'>General selections</h2>
<p>If you select the tab <em>General</em> you can define the following preferences:</p>
<p><strong>House system</strong>. Currently only house systems with 12 houses are supported. 
  Select <em>None</em> if you do not want to use a house system. </p>
<p><strong>Type of zodiac</strong>. Select either <em>sidereal</em> or <em>tropical</em>. 
  If you select tropical, the Ayanamsha will always be None, if you select another Ayanamsha, the setting for Type of 
  zodiac will automatically change into sidereal.</p>
<p><strong>Ayanamsha</strong>. Select one of the available Ayanamshas. 
  The paragraph <em>Ayanamshas overview</em> in the user manual gives a short explanation of the different types. 
  See the remarks at the point above: Type of zodiac.</p>
<p><strong>Observer position</strong>. The standard approach is <em>geocentric</em>, if you want to take parallax into 
  account select <em>topocentric</em>. In future releases the option <em>heliocentric</em> will be supported.</p>
<p><strong>Type of projection to the ecliptic</strong>. Select <em>Standard (two-dimensional)</em> for most approaches. 
  <em>Oblique longitude</em> provides an alternative calculation as supported by the School of Ram. 
  It is also called <em>True Astrological Longitude Location</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Base orbs</strong>. You can define orbs for aspects and for midpoints. </p>
<p>The base orb for aspects will be corrected with the percentages for celestial bodies and aspects. 
  See the paragraph Orbs for Aspects in the User Manual. 
  The value indicates the maximum orb for the most important aspect and the most important celestial body.</p>
<p>The base orb for midpoints is the effective orb for midpoints.</p>

<h2 id='celestial-points'>Points</h2>
<p>The tab <em>Celestial points</em> shows the points you can use for your chart.</p>
<p>For each point you will find a checkbox. Check this box if you want to take the celestial point into account, 
  deselect it if you do not want to use it. </p>
<p>There is also a value <em>Orb perc.</em> (Orb percentage) that you can change. 
  You can enter a percentage from 0 up to 100, make sure you use only whole numbers. 
  It is possible to define a percentage for a point that is not selected so it is easy to reuse a percentage if you 
  later decide to include the point. 
  If you want to use a point but not calculate aspects for that point, enter a percentage of zero.</p>
<p>See the paragraph <em>Celestial Points Overview</em> in the User Manual for an explanation for each point.</p>

<h2 id='aspects'>Aspects</h2>
<p><em>Aspects</em> is the third tab for the configuration. First you need to select a <em>method for defining orbs</em>. 
  You have three possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed orb</strong>. Use only one orb for all celestial points and all major aspects. 
  For minor aspects and micro aspects you can define a different orb. This is not yet supported in this release.</li>
<li><strong>Weighted orb</strong>. Use percentages for celestial bodies and for aspects to define the actual orb.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic/historical orb</strong>. Take the historical development of the orb into account. 
  Not yet supported in this release.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the paragraph <em>Appendix: Defining orbs</em> in the User Manual for more information. </p>
<p>For each aspect you (de)select using the checkbox and define the percentage for the orb. </p>
<p>To calculate aspects to all cusps, select the checkbox <em>Calculate aspects to cusp</em>. 
  Enigma shows the results of the aspects to cusps if you create a list of aspects, but not in the chart wheel.</p>

<h2 id='colors'>Colors</h2>  
<p><em>Colors</em> is the last tab. You can define a color for each aspect. The choice is limited to 15 colors that are all clearly visible in a drawing. You can define colors for all aspects, even if you do not use them. If you change the configuration and include an aspect, the selected color will automatically be used.</p>
<p>The right column shows the available colors. You can change the folors in the middle column, with the label <i>Color</i>, by typing the color name. You need to type the name of the color exactly as shown in the right column, including the used capitalization. There is never a space in a color name.<p>
<p>Enigma checks the color names before saving the configuration and shows a warning if it sees a typo.</p>
