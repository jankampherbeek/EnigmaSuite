    <h1>Results of progressive techniques</h1>
    <p>Enigma supports transits, secundary directions and symbolic directions.
        This screen shows the results for each of these techniques.</p>
    <p>The title at the top of the screen indicates the used technique.
        Underneath the title you will find the name and date/time details for the current chart.
        The blue box to the right contains information about the housesystem, zodiac and observer position.
    </p>
    <p>You see the calculated positions via the tab <i>Positions</i>.
        The tab <i>Aspects with radix</i> shows the aspects from these positions to the radix.
    </p>
    <p>Via the tab positions you see the vales for longitude, latitude, right ascension and declination.
        If you calculated symbolic directions, only the longitude is shown, as the other coordinates are undefined 
        for symbolic directions.
