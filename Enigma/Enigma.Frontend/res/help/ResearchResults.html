<h1>Research Results</h1>
<p>The results of the research are shown in tabular format. Of course these results depend on the type of test that you performed. 
    You will see two tabs, one for <strong>Test data</strong> and one for <strong>Control data</strong>. Each of these tabs shows the result of the respective counts.</p>
<p>These results are automatically saved to disk as a text file. At the bottom of the screen you will find the location of the files for test data and for control data.</p>
