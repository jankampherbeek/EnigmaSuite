    <p>In this screen you define additional details for harmonics. </p>
    <h2 id='harmonic-number'>Harmonic number</h2>
    <p>You need to enter the number of the harmonic. 
        In most cases this will be an integer value but Enigma also supports fractional numbers. 
        There is almost no limit,  you can calculate the harmonics up to 100,000. 
        Of course an extremely large number might effect the accuracy of the results.</p>
    <p>If your harmonic number is not correctly defined you will be warned with a popup after pressing the OK-button. </p>
    <h2 id='orb-2'>Orb</h2>
    <p>You can define your own orb in positive numeric values, the minutes should be between 0 and 59. 
        The maximum total size is 9°59&#39;. </p>
