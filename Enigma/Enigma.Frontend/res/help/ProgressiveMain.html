    <h1>Enigma - Progressive techniques</h1>
    <p>
        This is the start with screen for the calculation of progressive techniques. 
        Currently, Enigma supports transits, secundary directions and symbolic directions.
    </p>
    <h2>Working with events</h2>
    <p>
        You need to define an event before you can use any of the progressive techniques.
        Events are saved in the database and the same event can be used for all techniques. 
        An event is always coupled to the chart; you cannot define one event for several charts.</p>
    <p>Under the header <em>Available events</em> you see all events that are currently available for the chart you 
        are working on. 
        Above the same header, Enigma shows the name for the chart and the currently selected event. 
    </p>
    <p>You need to select an available event - or create a new event and select it - before most of the functionality 
        will become available.</p>
    <h2>Creating an event</h2>
    <p>
        You can define an event by clicking the button <strong>New event</strong> or by selecting the menu item 
        <strong>Events</strong> - <strong>New Event</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>Deleting an event</h2>
    <p>After selecting an event, you can delete it by clicking the button <strong>Delete event</strong> or by selecting
    the menu item <strong>Events</strong> - <strong>Delete event</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>For progressive techniques you use two configurations. 
        The general configuration that is also used for working with charts in general, and an additional 
        configuration for progressions.</p>
    <p>Both configurations are accessible via the menu: <strong>General</strong>. 
        Select either <strong>Configuration</strong> or <strong>Config progressions</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Progressive techniques</h2>
    <p>After selecting an event, you can calculate the positions for this event with one of the available techniques.
        Select one of the buttons <strong>Secundary dir.</strong>, <strong>Transits</strong> 
        or <strong>Symbolic dir.</strong>
        Alternatively, you can select one of the techniques in the menu underneath <strong>Techniques</strong>.
