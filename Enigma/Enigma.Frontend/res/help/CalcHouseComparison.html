    <h1>Compare house systems</h1>
    <p>This calculator compares the results of two different house systems.</p>
    <h2>Two systems</h2>
    <p>Select two systems in the combo boxes and make sure that these systems are different. 
        Enigma only compares quadrant-systems. 
        The APC-system is not included as it does not have oppositional cusps.</p>
    <h2>Latitude</h2>
    <p>You also need to define the geographic latitude for which the comparison will be performed.
        Make sure to enter a value in the format <strong>dd:mm:ss</strong>. 
        There is no need to select North or South: for a comparison that would not make any difference.</p>
    <h2>Date</h2>
    <p>For a correct comparison, the value of the obliquity of the earth's axis is required. 
        Therefore, Enigma needs the date, which you can enter in the format <strong>yyyy/mm/dd</strong>.
        The date is always assumed to be an astronomical date in the Gregorian Calendar. 
        Of course, the differences between Julian and Gregorian would not have a noticeable effect, 
        due to the relative stability of the earth's axis.</p>
    <h2>Compare</h2>
    <p>Click the button <strong>Compare</strong> to start the comparison.
        If you did not enter all required information, or if you used a wrong format, 
        you will get a popup window with an explanation of what is wrong.
        You will need to fix the input to start the comparison.</p>
