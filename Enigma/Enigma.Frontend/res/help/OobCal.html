<h1>Out of Bounds Calendar</h1>

<p>
    The Out of Bounds (OOB) Calendar contains an overview of the start and end of an OOB period.
    The period contains 120 years, starting from birth.
    The first rows in the table show the initial positions: 
    <i>OOB</i> or <i>In Bounds</i> and an indication for North and South declination.
</p>
<p>
    The following rows show the date when a change occurs, the point that changed, and an indication of the type of change.
    The calculation is based on secondary directions: 
    the 120 years of life in the table correspond with the first 120 days after birth.
</p>
<p>
    Enigma omits points that have no latitude because they can never be OOB. 
    So you will see no Sun or Lunar nodes. 
    You will also see no hypothetical planets: the declination, if given, is far too uncertain to make this calculation.
</p>
<p>
    For each day, the obliquity is calculated. 
    So the exact value for OOB can differ slightly for the given period. 
    The obliquity used is the true obliquity: the obliquity that is corrected for nutation.
