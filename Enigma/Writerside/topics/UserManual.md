# User Manual Enigma Astrology Research
## Version 0.2

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in Enigma. 
You are about to learn about a program that calculates charts and also supports several types of research into astrology.

You can use it for your astrological calculations. Enigma is accurate and calculates fast. 
It will produce a chart wheel and perform the most important analysis.

The program also supports several types of research: counting aspects, occupied midpoints and more. 
And it generates control groups so that you can cancel out artifacts.

Several other releases will follow and each new release will add more functionality.

Enigma is free: you do not have to pay for it. 
And Enigma is open source: I published all code, and anybody can download it. 
Programmers that want to use my code can do so freely, but only if their own software is also open source.

I hope you enjoy the program!

Jan Kampherbeek.

## **Installation**

### Requirements

You need a computer that runs Windows. 
I have tested Enigma on Windows 11, it probably runs on older versions, but not older than Windows 7. 
Enigma will probably run in a Windows emulator on Apple hardware, but I did not test that.

The program requires about 150 mb disk space and about 4 GB internal memory.

Preferably, use a full HD screen or larger.

### Performing the installation

Download the installation program from [*https://radixpro.com/enigma*](https://radixpro.com/downloads/enigma). You will receive a file e*nigma_ar_install.exe* which you can save anywhere on your computer.

Double-click this file to start the installation.

Enigma shows a license which you should accept to continue. Select *I accept the agreement* and click the button **Next**.
